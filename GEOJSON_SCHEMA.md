### Reading the schema
Tofix accepts a geojson, so all the regular [geojson](http://geojson.org/) and [json](http://www.json.org/) schema rules apply automatically.

- Do not assume anything that is not explicitly written.
- `?` indicates an optional property.
```JSON
// this means `propA` is not required.
"propA"?: string
```
- `A<string>`: indicates `A` is a subset of string.
Example -
 ```
 // link is a type of URI which is to be sent as a string
 "link": URI<string>
 ```
 - ` X | Y `: indicates either type `X` or `Y`
 ```
 // `propA` could either be  "Point" or  "PolyLine"
"propA": "Point" | "PolyLine"
 ```
- `MUST`: (in all caps) anywhere in the documentation, means that something is required and that not following this statement will result in errors.
- `SHOULD`: (in all caps) anywhere in the documentation, means that something isnâ€™t strictly required, but that not following the statement will result in unexpected outcomes.


## the item `featureCollection` property

All geometric attributes of an Item MUST be stored as Features in an item's `featureCollection` field. There are no exceptions to this rule. Because these properties have semantic meaning to to-fix, all features MUST also follow the guidelines described in the "feature property guidelines" section below.
